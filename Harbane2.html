        <p class="Harbane2Description"> 
          Harbane 2 was the second SMP created and was played on the version 1.17. It was created on the 16th of August 2021 and ended on the 26th of November 2021. For some Harbane 2 was the greatest smp for them and after the Harbanians over threw Justin Bendo as their leader in Harbane 1 they got a new leader for Harbane 2 his name was Harbane, yes the same Harbane that founded Harbane™️. And this new leader was different, he created his own server host with the best server performance and a very low server latency,  he made Harbane SMP great again. He was also well known for going lengths to stop cheater, griefers and anyone that ruined the experience of Harbane SMP. He even created a page of terms and conditions so every player knew the term to play on the SMP and if they broke those term they get banned, and to this day Harbane run the Harbane SMP and to this day players have to agree to those terms and conditions created by Harbane. Harbane 2 was a great smp and lasted a pretty decent time. Players had alot of fun in it they build many many farms and great structures. But all good this must come to an end. On November 26th 2021 at 7:28 Pm AEST disaster struck, Harbane made a back up of the SMP so him and his friends can nuke the SMP for fun because ether were bored. But little did they know that the back up failed and they were nuking the actual SMP, so after they nuked the server soo much that it crashed the server,  Harbane went back to the server files and there it was gone, acouple weeks before 1.18 came out, Harbane 2 was gone, gone forever. A sense of grief and sadness swept through the Harbanians. From now on Harbane always makes a back up every couple days so this never happens.
