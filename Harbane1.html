        <h1 class="section2">What is Harbane 1</h1>
        <h2 class="section2">Harbane 1 was the first SMP, and it also happened to be the shortest. 
            Despite the fact that Harbane 1 lasted only 12 days, we were able to 
            obtain full netherite, create numerous farms and ultimately beat the 
            game. Nonetheless, Harbane 1 was operated by a man (for the sake 
            of keeping his name out of the public domain, we'll call him Justin 
            Bendo) who was notorious for abusing his privellages and at times
             even hacked, He held a decent role in the building of Harbane SMP
             and also had a major role in its destruction. In Harbane 1, he 
            used operator commands for his own benefit, causing the SMP to 
            collapse and, to put it mildly, being "deposed from his throne". The 
            members of Harbane 1 are the following people:
